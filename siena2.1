<hr><p><b>SIENA Methods</b>

<p>Two-timepoint percentage brain volume change was estimated with
SIENA [Smith 2001, Smith 2002], part of FSL [Smith 2004]. SIENA starts
by extracting brain and skull images from the two-timepoint whole-head
input data [Smith 2002b]. The two brain images are then aligned to
each other [Jenkinson 2001, Jenkinson 2002] (using the skull images to
constrain the registration scaling); both brain images are resampled
into the space halfway between the two. Next, tissue-type segmentation
is carried out [Zhang 2001] in order to find brain/non-brain edge
points, and then perpendicular edge displacement (between the two
timepoints) is estimated at these edge points. Finally, the mean edge
displacement is converted into a (global) estimate of percentage brain
volume change between the two timepoints.
